# H2-Canteen-Sample-Website
This is the website, I made as an assignment, to contesting for the Web-Secy of H2. It is neither a jaw-dropping website nor a very responsive website, as this is the first time I had touched HTML and CSS in years. But it was a great booster for me, to at least revise, what I already knew.

I further plan to learn Javascript to improve my front-end, and Django and Php to improve my backe-end skills(which are almost non-existent).
